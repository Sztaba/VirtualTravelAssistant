I love spending time in parks, especially ones with breathtaking scenery like the Grand Canyon. It's a reminder of the beauty of nature.
While I'm not much into sports, I do enjoy going to the cinema to catch the latest movies. It's a fun way to unwind and be entertained.
Exploring landmarks like the Eiffel Tower is always a highlight of my travels. The history and significance behind these iconic structures fascinate me.
