I always seek out historical sites like castles and ruins when I travel. There's something magical about stepping back in time and imagining life centuries ago.
My favorite part of traveling is immersing myself in different cultures. Whether it's visiting temples or attending local festivals, I love experiencing the rich diversity our world has to offer.
When I travel, I prioritize exploring architectural marvels like cathedrals and mosques. The intricate details and spiritual significance behind these structures fascinate me endlessly.
